# Stride Well App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Start New Session" Button Fix
The "Start New Session" button was previously refreshing the page instead of properly resetting state, which caused a poor user experience. We fixed this by:
- Updating the `resetWorkoutProgress` function in `WorkoutProgress.tsx` to properly clear localStorage and reset component state
- Improving the `handleWorkoutCompleted` function in `TodayWorkout.tsx` to correctly handle the reset without using a setTimeout delay

### 2. Workout History Fix
Workout logs were incorrectly showing "Your Custom Workout" instead of the proper workout names. We fixed this by:
- Enhancing the isCompletedWorkout function to better determine workout types
- Adding checks in the WorkoutHistory component to display workout names properly, checking both workout_name and workout.name attributes
- Creating a getWorkoutDisplayName helper function to provide consistent naming logic

### 3. Exercise Logging Error Fix
The exercise logging functionality was experiencing 400/403 errors. We fixed this by:
- Enhancing the log_exercise_completion function with proper error handling
- Adding validation to skip temporary exercise IDs (those starting with default-)
- Adding a fallback to direct database inserts when RPC calls fail
- Improving error logging to better diagnose issues

### 4. Database Schema Fix
We applied SQL updates to add missing columns and improve the workout tracking functionality:
- Added workout_name, workout_description, workout_type, and is_custom columns to the workout_logs table
- Updated the complete_workout function to properly handle all parameters
- Fixed issues with null values in existing records

## How to Verify
1. "Start New Session" button now correctly resets exercises without refreshing the page
2. Workout history shows proper workout names
3. Exercise logging no longer produces errors
4. Completed workouts are correctly displayed in the history

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application to ensure all fixes are working as expected
- Update the documentation to reflect the changes made
- Consider additional enhancements to improve the workout tracking experience
