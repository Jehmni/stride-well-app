# Stride Well App - Fixes Implemented

## 1. Upper Body Workout Exercise Filtering Fix

**Problem:** Upper body workouts were not properly filtering out leg exercises, causing inappropriate exercises to appear in the workout.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the exercise filtering logic in `TodayWorkout.tsx` to specifically handle upper body workouts
- Added more specific muscle group filtering to ensure only upper body exercises are included
- Implemented additional filter conditions to exclude any exercises that contain 'leg' or 'lower' in their muscle group description
- Added more muscle group categories to ensure comprehensive coverage (biceps, triceps, etc.)

## 2. Cross-Device Workout Progress Synchronization

**Problem:** Workout progress was only stored locally in localStorage, preventing users from continuing workouts across different devices.

**Solution:**
- Created a new `workout_progress` table in Supabase to store workout progress data
- Implemented a secure PostgreSQL function `sync_workout_progress` for syncing data
- Added TypeScript definitions and RPC function in the frontend to interact with this backend functionality
- Updated the `WorkoutProgress` component to:
  - Fetch remote progress when initializing
  - Synchronize local progress to the remote database when exercises are completed
  - Handle conflict resolution when local and remote data have different states
  - Show sync status and timestamps to users

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.workout_progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  workout_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  completed_exercises TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT workout_progress_user_workout_unique UNIQUE (user_id, workout_id)
);
```

### Database Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_workout_progress(
  user_id_param UUID,
  workout_id_param TEXT,
  completed_exercises_param TEXT[]
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Upsert the workout progress
  INSERT INTO public.workout_progress (user_id, workout_id, completed_exercises, last_updated)
  VALUES (user_id_param, workout_id_param, completed_exercises_param, NOW())
  ON CONFLICT (user_id, workout_id) 
  DO UPDATE SET 
    completed_exercises = completed_exercises_param,
    last_updated = NOW();
    
  RETURN TRUE;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$;
```

### TypeScript Integration
- Added `SyncWorkoutProgressParams` interface to the RPC types
- Created `syncWorkoutProgressRPC` function to call the database function
- Updated database types to include the new table and function definitions
- Implemented the sync logic in the `WorkoutProgress` component

## User Experience Improvements
- Progress is automatically synced when a user completes an exercise
- Users can manually trigger a sync with a sync button
- Sync status is displayed to users (synced/unsynced/error)
- The last sync time is shown to users
- Conflict resolution logic ensures the most up-to-date progress is used

## Testing
- Verified that Upper Body workouts now only show appropriate upper body exercises
- Confirmed that workout progress successfully syncs between different devices
- Ensured that the conflict resolution logic works correctly when there are differences between local and remote data
