# Localhost Access Fix Guide

## Problem
Your app loads on `http://192.168.1.178:8080/` but not on `http://localhost:8080/`

## Root Cause
The issue was in your `vite.config.ts` file where `host: "::"` was binding the server to IPv6 interfaces only, which can interfere with localhost access.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
```typescript
server: {
  // Fixed: Changed from host: "::" to host: true
  host: true, // Allows access from both localhost and network IP
  port: 8080,
  strictPort: true,
  cors: true,
  open: false,
  // Better localhost handling
  hmr: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 8080,
  },
  // Development-specific settings
  ...(mode === 'development' && {
    logLevel: 'info',
  }),
}
```

### 2. Added New Dev Script (`package.json`)
```json
"dev:localhost": "vite --host localhost --port 8080"
```

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `scripts/test-localhost.js` - Node.js test script
- `scripts/test-localhost.bat` - Windows batch file

## üöÄ How to Fix

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Configuration (Recommended)
1. Stop your current dev server
2. The configuration is already fixed - just restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Use Localhost-Specific Script
```bash
npm run dev:localhost
```

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Restart
```bash
npm run clear-cache
npm run dev
```

## üîç Test Your Fix

### Using the Test Script
```bash
node scripts/test-localhost.js
```

### Using the Batch File (Windows)
```bash
scripts\test-localhost.bat
```

### Manual Test
1. Open browser
2. Try `http://localhost:8080/`
3. Should now work!

## üß† Why This Happened

- `host: "::"` binds to IPv6 interfaces only
- Some systems have IPv6/IPv4 conflicts
- Network IP works because it bypasses localhost resolution
- `host: true` binds to all available interfaces (IPv4 + IPv6)

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

- Always use `host: true` for development
- Test both localhost and network IP after changes
- Use the diagnostic tools if issues arise
- Keep Vite configuration simple and standard

## üì± Additional Benefits

- Better HMR (Hot Module Replacement) handling
- Improved development experience
- Consistent behavior across different systems
- Better debugging with enhanced logging

## üö® If Still Not Working

1. Check if port 8080 is already in use:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   ```

2. Check your hosts file:
   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   ```
   Ensure it has:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 localhost
   ::1 localhost
   ```

3. Try a different port:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

4. Check Windows Firewall settings

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After applying these fixes:
- `http://localhost:8080/` ‚úÖ Should work
- `http://192.168.1.178:8080/` ‚úÖ Should still work
- Better development experience overall
