# Workout Display and Exercise Logging Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve issues with workout displays, exercise logging, and AI workout generation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Start New Session" Button Not Reloading Fresh Workouts

**Problem:** When clicking "Start New Session" after completing a workout, the page wasn't refreshing to show a new set of daily workouts.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the `resetWorkoutProgress` function in `WorkoutProgress.tsx` to reload the page after resetting the progress state
- This ensures that a fresh set of daily workouts is loaded when starting a new session

### 2. Custom Workouts Showing Instead of Completed Workouts

**Problem:** The workout history was showing "Custom Workout" for all workouts, even when they were completed workouts.

**Solution:**
- Added a new `isCompletedWorkout` function to better distinguish between custom and completed workouts
- Modified the workout display logic in `WorkoutHistory.tsx` to show "Completed Workout" for workouts that have logged exercises
- Fixed the workout title display logic to properly reflect the workout type

### 3. AI Workout Display Formatting Issues

**Problem:** AI-generated workouts weren't displaying properly because the weekly structure and exercise data wasn't being correctly formatted.

**Solution:**
- Added validation for the weekly structure data in `saveAIWorkoutPlan` function
- Created a `generateDefaultWeeklyStructure` function to provide a fallback structure when the AI response is malformed
- Ensured the data is consistently formatted before being stored in the database

## Applied Changes

1. **WorkoutProgress.tsx**
   - Modified `resetWorkoutProgress` to reload the page

2. **WorkoutHistory.tsx**
   - Added `isCompletedWorkout` function
   - Updated workout title display logic

3. **WorkoutAIService.ts**
   - Added data validation for weekly structure
   - Implemented `generateDefaultWeeklyStructure` function for fallback
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Testing the Changes

To verify these fixes are working correctly:

1. **Test "Start New Session":** Complete a workout, then click "Start New Session" to ensure it loads fresh workouts

2. **Test Workout History:** Complete a workout, then check the workout history to confirm it shows "Completed Workout" rather than "Custom Workout"

3. **Test AI Workout Display:** Generate an AI workout plan and verify that the weekly structure displays properly with all 7 days of the week and their respective focus areas
