# Additional Critical Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ OpenAI API Endpoint Issue
**Problem**: `POST http://localhost:8080/undefined 404 (Not Found)`
- The OpenAI client was receiving an undefined endpoint URL

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `openAIClient.ts` to always use the correct OpenAI endpoint: `"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`
- Removed dependency on potentially undefined config values
- Set reliable model: `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`

### 2. ✅ Database Schema Issue - Missing name Field
**Problem**: `null value in column "name" of relation "workout_plans" violates not-null constraint`
- The `workout_plans` table has a required `name` column that wasn't being populated

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `workoutService.ts` to include `name: plan.title` in the insert operation
- The `name` field now uses the same value as `title` to satisfy the NOT NULL constraint

### 3. ✅ React Formatting and Spacing Issues
**Problem**: Malformed JSX with spacing issues in `WorkoutStatistics.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed indentation and spacing in the muscle groups and exercises mapping
- Ensured proper JSX structure for better readability and maintenance

### 4. ⚠️ Remaining 406 Errors
**Status**: Monitoring
- The 406 errors may be related to RLS policies or temporary issues
- Current RLS policy appears correctly configured for authenticated users
- Server restart should help clear any cached policy issues

## Files Modified:
1. `src/integrations/ai/openAIClient.ts` - Fixed endpoint configuration
2. `src/services/workoutService.ts` - Added missing `name` field to database inserts
3. `src/components/workout/WorkoutStatistics.tsx` - Fixed JSX formatting

## Expected Results:
- ✅ OpenAI API calls should now use correct endpoint (no more 404s)
- ✅ AI workout plans should save to database without constraint violations
- ✅ Clean JSX rendering without formatting issues
- ⏳ 406 errors should be reduced or eliminated

## Next Steps:
- Monitor console for any remaining errors after server restart
- Test AI workout generation flow end-to-end
- Verify dashboard loads without database errors
