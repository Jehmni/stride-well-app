# Workout Filtering and Progress Sync Fixes

This document details the fixes implemented to address two specific issues in the Stride Well fitness app:

## 1. Exercise Filtering by Muscle Group

**Problem:** Upper body workouts were displaying inappropriate exercises like Squats and Running that should only appear in leg or cardio workouts.

**Solution:** Implemented proper muscle group filtering in TodayWorkout.tsx when fetching default exercises.

```typescript
// Before: Exercises were fetched without muscle group filtering
const { data: exercises, error } = await supabase
  .from('exercises')
  .select('*')
  .limit(5); // Just get some sample exercises
```

```typescript
// After: Exercises are now filtered by appropriate muscle groups based on workout focus
// Determine appropriate muscle groups based on workout focus
let muscleGroups: string[] = [];
const focusLower = todayWorkout.title.toLowerCase();

if (focusLower.includes('upper body') || focusLower.includes('chest') || focusLower.includes('arms')) {
  muscleGroups = ['chest', 'back', 'shoulders', 'arms'];
} else if (focusLower.includes('lower body') || focusLower.includes('leg')) {
  muscleGroups = ['legs'];
} else if (focusLower.includes('core') || focusLower.includes('ab')) {
  muscleGroups = ['core'];
} else if (focusLower.includes('cardio')) {
  // For cardio, filter by exercise type instead of muscle group
  const { data: exercises, error } = await supabase
    .from('exercises')
    .select('*')
    .in('exercise_type', ['cardio', 'hiit', 'endurance'])
    .limit(5);
    
  if (error) throw error;
  return exercises;
} else {
  // Full body or other workouts - mix of everything
  muscleGroups = ['chest', 'back', 'legs', 'shoulders', 'arms', 'core'];
}

// Fetch exercises filtered by appropriate muscle groups
const { data: exercises, error } = await supabase
  .from('exercises')
  .select('*')
  .in('muscle_group', muscleGroups)
  .limit(5);
```

## 2. Hybrid LocalStorage and Supabase for Workout Progress

**Problem:** The app was only using localStorage for workout progress tracking, without synchronization across devices.

**Solution:** Implemented a hybrid approach that keeps localStorage for immediate UI updates and offline functionality while adding Supabase database syncing.

### Key Components of the Solution:

1. Created a new database migration (`20250508000000_add_workout_progress.sql`) to add:
   - `workout_progress` table to store in-progress workout states
   - RPC function for cross-device progress syncing

2. Enhanced `WorkoutProgress.tsx` with:
   - Continued localStorage usage for immediate UI updates and offline functionality
   - Added Supabase syncing for cross-device state persistence
   - Added sync indicator and manual sync button to UI
   - Automatic syncing on component mount and when exercises are completed

### Benefits of this Hybrid Approach:

- **Immediate UI Updates**: Using localStorage ensures the UI remains responsive
- **Offline Functionality**: Progress tracking works even without internet connection
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Users can continue workouts on different devices
- **Sync Indicators**: Users can see when their progress was last synced
- **Manual Sync**: Users can manually trigger a sync if needed

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. The exercise filtering fix is a straightforward code change to `TodayWorkout.tsx`

2. For the workout progress syncing:
   - Run the included migration script: `./scripts/apply_workout_progress_migration.ps1`
   - This will create the necessary database table and functions

These changes maintain the existing UI experience while adding important new functionality for a better user experience.
