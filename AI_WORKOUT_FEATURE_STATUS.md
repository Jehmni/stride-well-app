## Database Schema

### workout_plans Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE workout_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Plan name/title
  description TEXT,                       -- Plan description
  fitness_goal TEXT NOT NULL,            -- User's fitness goal
  weekly_structure JSONB NOT NULL,       -- Weekly workout structure
  exercises JSONB NOT NULL,              -- Exercise details
  ai_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,    -- AI-generated flag
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id), -- User ownership
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### AI Configuration Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_configurations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  service_name TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'openai'
  api_key TEXT,                         -- API key (if stored in DB)
  api_endpoint TEXT,                    -- API endpoint URL
  model_name TEXT,                      -- Model name (gpt-4o)
  is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,     -- Service enabled flag
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```properties
# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
VITE_OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ruxnobvwdzyenucyimus.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own workout plans
- Users can only create workout plans for themselves
- AI configuration table is protected (backend access only)

### API Key Security
- OpenAI API key is stored in environment variables
- No API keys exposed to client-side code
- Secure server-side API calls only

## User Flow

1. **Access**: User navigates to Dashboard → AI Workout Card → "Create AI Workout"
2. **Form**: User fills out the Enhanced AI Workout Form with preferences
3. **Generation**: System generates personalized prompt and calls OpenAI API
4. **Processing**: AI response is parsed and validated
5. **Storage**: Workout plan is saved to Supabase with user ownership
6. **Display**: User is redirected to the workout plan detail page
7. **Access**: User can view saved AI workouts from various sections of the app

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt Engineering
The system creates detailed prompts that include:
- User demographic data (age, sex, height, weight, BMI)
- Fitness goals and preferences
- Available equipment
- Focus areas and specific goals
- Body measurements (if available and opted-in)
- Structured JSON response format requirements

### Response Processing
- JSON response validation and parsing
- Exercise data structuring
- Weekly schedule organization
- Proper data type conversion for database storage

### Error Handling
- OpenAI API error handling (401, 429, 500 errors)
- Network error recovery
- Fallback generation methods
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
