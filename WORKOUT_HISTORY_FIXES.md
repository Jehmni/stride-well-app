# Workout History Display Fix

This document explains the fixes applied to the Stride Well app to correct workout history display issues.

## Problems Fixed

1. **Exercise Display Issue**: AI-generated workout plans (like "Full Body & Cardio Workout") were not showing exercises
2. **Workout History Display Issue**: Completed workouts incorrectly appeared in "Your Custom Workouts" instead of "Workout History"

## Technical Root Causes

### Exercise Display Issue

AI-generated workout plans store exercises in a JSON field but don't map them to the `workout_exercises` table. The fix involves:

1. Creating a mapper utility to extract exercises from JSON format
2. Updating components to use this mapper when displaying workouts
3. Adding enhanced logging for better debugging

### Workout History Display Issue

Completed workouts were not properly marked with the correct `workout_type` and `is_custom` flags. The fix involves:

1. Adding missing columns to the `workout_logs` table if they don't exist
2. Setting the correct values for existing records:
   - `workout_type = 'completed'` for completed workouts
   - `is_custom = false` for completed workouts
   - Adding proper workout names

## Fix Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

The following columns were added to the `workout_logs` table:
- `workout_type`: VARCHAR - To differentiate between 'completed', 'planned', or 'custom' workouts
- `is_custom`: BOOLEAN - To indicate if a workout is user-created
- `workout_name`: VARCHAR - For better display in the history section

### Data Fixes

1. All existing workout logs were marked as 'completed'
2. All completed workouts were set to `is_custom = false`
3. Workout names were populated based on the linked workout
4. An index was added to improve query performance

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the `fix_workouts.bat` script located in the scripts directory. This will:

1. Check for required dependencies
2. Apply database schema changes
3. Update existing data
4. Report the number of fixed records

After running the script, restart the application to see the changes.

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:

1. Exercises displayed correctly for all workout plans, including AI-generated ones
2. Completed workouts appearing in the "Workout History" section
3. No completed workouts appearing in the "Your Custom Workouts" section

## Technical Details

The fix uses the Supabase JavaScript client to apply both schema and data changes, ensuring compatibility with the Supabase Model-Context Protocol (MCP) server. The script creates all necessary structures and updates the data in a transaction-safe manner.

## Future Prevention

1. Enhanced logging has been added to AI workout generation
2. The workout plan mapper utility ensures consistent exercise display
3. The updated components correctly mark workout types during completion

These changes ensure that future AI-generated workout plans will display correctly and completed workouts will be properly categorized in the application.
