## 🏗️ Component Architecture Recommendations

### **Current Issues:**
- ❌ 1129-line MealPlan.tsx (maintenance nightmare)
- ❌ Mixed concerns (UI + business logic + API calls)
- ❌ Complex state management (30+ useState hooks)

### **Proposed Modular Structure:**

```
📁 src/components/meal-plan/
├── 📄 MealPlanDashboard.tsx         # Main orchestrator
├── 📄 ProfileSetup.tsx              # Fitness profile management
├── 📄 AIGenerator.tsx               # AI meal plan generation
├── 📄 MealPlanViewer.tsx           # Display generated plans
├── 📄 MealCustomizer.tsx           # Meal substitutions & adjustments
├── 📄 GroceryListManager.tsx       # Shopping list management
├── 📄 NutritionTracker.tsx         # Daily nutrition logging
├── 📄 StoreLocator.tsx             # Store finder integration
└── 📄 ProgressAnalytics.tsx        # Nutrition progress insights

📁 src/hooks/meal-plan/
├── 📄 useMealPlanGenerator.ts      # AI generation logic
├── 📄 useMealPlanData.ts          # Data fetching & caching
├── 📄 useNutritionCalculations.ts # Macro/calorie calculations
└── 📄 useGroceryOptimization.ts   # Shopping list optimization

📁 src/services/meal-plan/
├── 📄 aiMealPlanService.ts        # OpenAI integration
├── 📄 nutritionCalculatorService.ts # BMR/TDEE calculations
├── 📄 groceryOptimizationService.ts # Store/price optimization
└── 📄 mealPlanPersistenceService.ts # Database operations
```

## 🎯 Business Logic Optimization

### **1. Intelligent Defaults System**
```typescript
// Smart profile inference from existing data
const inferUserPreferences = (profile: UserProfile, workoutHistory: Workout[]) => {
  // Analyze workout patterns to suggest nutrition goals
  // Use demographic data for sensible defaults
  // Consider seasonal preferences and trends
}
```

### **2. Progressive Meal Planning**
```typescript
// Start simple, add complexity over time
const generateProgressivePlan = (userExperience: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced') => {
  // Beginner: Simple meals, basic macros
  // Intermediate: Meal prep, macro cycling
  // Advanced: Precision nutrition, performance optimization
}
```

### **3. Budget-Aware Optimization**
```typescript
// Optimize for cost while maintaining nutrition goals
const optimizeForBudget = (mealPlan: MealPlan, weeklyBudget: number) => {
  // Prioritize affordable protein sources
  // Suggest bulk cooking strategies
  // Identify seasonal produce discounts
}
```

### **4. Real-Time Adaptation**
```typescript
// Adapt plans based on user behavior
const adaptPlanBasedOnUsage = (plan: MealPlan, userFeedback: UserFeedback[]) => {
  // Learn from meal ratings and completions
  // Adjust portion sizes based on satiety feedback
  // Modify complexity based on cooking adherence
}
```
