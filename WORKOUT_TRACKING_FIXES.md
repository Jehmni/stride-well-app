# Stride Well App - Workout Tracking Fixes

## Issues Fixed

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address issues with the workout tracking functionality in the Stride Well fitness app. The main problems were:

1. Completed workouts were incorrectly showing as "Your Custom Workout"
2. The "Start New Session" button wasn't properly reloading fresh daily workouts
3. Exercise logging was failing with 400 errors
4. Custom workouts were being displayed instead of completed workouts in the history

## Database Schema Fixes

### 1. Updated `workout_logs` Table

Added new columns to properly track workout types:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.workout_logs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS workout_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS workout_description TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS workout_type TEXT DEFAULT 'completed' CHECK (workout_type IN ('completed', 'custom', 'scheduled')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_custom BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### 2. Added Database Functions

Created and updated the following functions to improve workout logging:

- `exec_sql`: For secure SQL execution
- `create_workout_log`: Properly records workout completions
- `log_exercise_completion`: Tracks exercise completion data
- `complete_workout`: A new function that handles workout completion with proper typing

### 3. Updated RLS Policies

Row Level Security policies were updated to ensure users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Allow users to view only their own exercise logs
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own exercise logs"
ON public.exercise_logs
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM workout_logs 
    WHERE workout_logs.id = exercise_logs.workout_log_id
    AND workout_logs.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

Added indexes for faster queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_workout_logs_user_id_completed_at 
ON public.workout_logs(user_id, completed_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_exercise_logs_workout_log_id 
ON public.exercise_logs(workout_log_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_exercise_logs_exercise_id 
ON public.exercise_logs(exercise_id);
```

## Frontend Fixes

### 1. WorkoutHistory Component

Updated to correctly distinguish between custom workouts and completed workouts:

- Added `isCompletedWorkout` function to properly identify workout types
- Fixed workout title display logic

### 2. WorkoutProgress Component

Improved workout session tracking and reset functionality:

- Updated `resetWorkoutProgress` to properly reload the page
- Enhanced the completion tracking to properly categorize completed workouts

### 3. workoutService.ts

Updated workout logging functions:

- Enhanced `logWorkoutCompletion` to set the proper workout type
- Added fallback to the RPC function for better reliability

### 4. AI Workout Generation

Added validation for AI-generated workout data:

- Created `generateDefaultWeeklyStructure` function as a fallback
- Improved error handling for malformed AI responses

## Testing Notes

After applying these fixes:

1. Completed workouts should now correctly show up as completed workouts in history
2. The "Start New Session" button should reload fresh daily workouts
3. Exercise logging should work without errors
4. Workout history should correctly differentiate between custom and completed workouts

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Implement Client-Side Validation**: Add more robust validation in the frontend before sending requests to the server
2. **Add Error Recovery**: Implement better error recovery mechanisms to handle failed requests
3. **Improve Data Caching**: Consider adding client-side caching for workout data to reduce server load
