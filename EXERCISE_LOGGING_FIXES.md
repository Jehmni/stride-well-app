# Exercise Logging Fixes

## Issues Fixed
1. **Completed exercises not showing in progress view**: Fixed by updating how exercise logs are fetched in WorkoutHistory component
2. **"Failed to create workout log" error**: Fixed by improving the PostgreSQL function `log_exercise_completion` and error handling

## Changes Made

### SQL Functions
1. Created proper `exec_sql` function to support raw SQL queries
2. Fixed the `log_exercise_completion` function to work reliably:
   - Removed strict auth checks that were causing failures
   - Added better error handling and validation
   - Updated RLS policies to work with the function
3. Added validation script to clean up any invalid exercise logs

### Frontend Changes
1. Updated WorkoutHistory component to fetch exercise logs directly without relying on custom SQL
2. Improved error handling and validation in ExerciseLogForm
3. Added better logging to help with future debugging

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the database migration script:
   - On Windows: `scripts\apply_db_fixes.bat`
   - On Linux/Mac: `./scripts/apply_db_fixes.sh`
2. Restart the application

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should be able to:
1. Log completed exercises without errors
2. See completed exercises in the Progress view
3. Have previously completed exercises show up in your workout history

If issues persist, check the console logs for error messages which will be more detailed now.
